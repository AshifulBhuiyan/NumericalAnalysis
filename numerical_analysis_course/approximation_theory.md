# Module 3: Approximation Theory

This module explores methods for approximating functions, which is crucial when exact solutions are unknown or too complex.

## Topics Covered

*   Polynomial Interpolation (Lagrange, Newton's divided differences)
*   Spline Interpolation (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic splines)
*   Fourier Analysis and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
*   Least Squares Approximation

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand different methods for interpolating data points.
*   Learn how to use splines for smoother approximations.
*   Grasp the fundamentals of Fourier series and the efficiency of FFT.
*   Apply least squares methods for fitting functions to data.
